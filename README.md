Note:  
For Compilation  
1. You should not have package names in your Submission  
2. You should not have unnecessary System.out.println in your code  

For Submission  
1. Choose right data type for storing the data (to avoid overflow issues)  
2. It should take less time for large number of data set  

Week 1
The folder week1_programming_challenges/1_sum_of_two_digits in the src\main\resources\coursera.zip file contains 
solutions to this problem in various programming languages.   
Select the solution in your favourite programming language and submit it under 
the "My submission" tab. More details on the submission process are given in Sum of Two Digits section of the file 
week1_programming_challenges/week1_programming_challenges.pdf in the same archive file.


Problem 1:  
In this very first programming challenge, your goal is to implement a program that reads two digits 
from the standard input and prints their sum to the standard output. We start from this simple problem to show 
you the pipeline of submitting a solution to the grading system. 

Problem 2: Solving the Maximum Pairwise Product Programming Challenge: Improving the Naive Solution, Testing, Debugging
