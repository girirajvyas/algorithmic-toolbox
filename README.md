Note:  
*For Compilation*  
1. You should not have package names in your Submission  
2. You should not have unnecessary System.out.println in your code  

*For Submission*  
1. Choose right data type for storing the data (to avoid overflow issues)  
2. It should take less time for large number of data set  

*Learnings*  
1. Choose correct Data type for given condition, you may encounter Integer overflows or incorrect output in case you use double instead of BigDecimal in case of money related problems     
2. Your algorithm should be fast  
3. It must consider the corner cases, it might me working for 1 scenario but will fail if we swap the order of input.  


**Week 1**  
1. Solving the sum of two digits programming challenge  
2. Learn how to submit solutions to CourSera by already provided solution  
3. Solving the maximum pairwise programming challenge  
4. Implement the naive solution.  
5. Improve the naive solution by choosing the correct data type to avoid integer overflow issue.  
6. Testing and debugging the problem.  	
7. Stress test by creating a large data set and run your solution against it


**Programming Challenge 1:**   Sum of Two Digits  
In this very first programming challenge, your goal is to implement a program that reads two digits 
from the standard input and prints their sum to the standard output. We start from this simple problem to show 
you the pipeline of submitting a solution to the grading system. 

The folder week1_programming_challenges/1_sum_of_two_digits in the src\main\resources\coursera.zip file contains 
solutions to this problem in various programming languages.   
Select the solution in your favourite programming language and submit it under 
the "My submission" tab. More details on the submission process are given in Sum of Two Digits section of the file 
week1_programming_challenges/week1_programming_challenges.pdf in the same archive file.

**Programming Challenge 2:** Maximum Pairwise Product: Improving the Naive Solution, Testing, Debugging  
In this programming challenge, your goal is to implement a program that works in less than one second even on  
huge datasets. In section Maximum Pairwise Product of the file week1_programming_challenges/week1_programming_challenges.pdf   
we walk you through a step-by-step process of solving this challenge. We will encounter several common pitfalls and   
will show you how to fix them.


**Week 2**  
1. Why study algorithm?  



**Programming Challenge 1:**   Fibonacci Numbers  
Trivia: Developed by Italian mathematician for calculating the growth of Rabbit population  

Naive Algorithm






**Programming Challenge 2:**   Greatest Common Divisors
